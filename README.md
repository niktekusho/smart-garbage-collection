# Smart Garbage Collection

## Concept

The idea of this project is to have an easy-to-configure service that provides data about garbage collection of my/your city.

This project will contain docs about the development process of it and will eventually link or contain the individual components/services needed to run it.

If all components will be inside this repository then it will be managed using a lerna monorepo.
